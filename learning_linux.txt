# By far the easiest way to check the number of RAM slots currently in use in your machine without opening it up 
is to use the DMI Table Decoder command called dmidecode, which gives you a flat report. 

type sudo dmidecode -t 16 # this enumeration is based on devices and not the actual physical count
type sudo dmidecode -t 17 and push enter to receive a complete list of physical cards plugged into the RAM slots on your computer.

sudo lshw -class memory
