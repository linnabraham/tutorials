--------------------
Initial configuraton
--------------------

# create a github account at github.com
# note down the username and email id
# create a new public or private repository on github and note down the address

# commands for configuring git on your system
# provide the same username and email id you used to signup for github

git config --global user.name <your username>
git config --global user.mail <your email>

git init <directoryname>	# initialise a new git repository
cd <directoryname> 		# change directory to the git repo

# connect the github repository with your local repo 
git remote add origin <github repo address>

git remote -v 			# to check which are the remotes currently attached

-------------
An alternate way to set up a git repository with a remote repository on github is to just create and initialise the repo on the github 
website and clone it to your disk
-------------

# create some files on your own

# to track those files
git add filename

git commit -m "your msg"	# commit your changes with a message

git push -u origin master	# for the first push
git push			# push your further changes to the remote (github) repo

# if changes are made from somewhere else to your remote repository
# you need to pull those changes to your local repo

git pull

# other commands 
git status 			# get info about your repo
git ls-files			# list files inside your repo

As a working example clone the repo containing this file.

git clone https://github.com/linnabraham/tutorials

--------------
More advanced usage
--------------

If you are editing a particular file and you are think of discarding all the changes (in the working directory) and get back the version that you had committed last, use:
git checkout -- <filename>
