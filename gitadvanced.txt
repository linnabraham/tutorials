How can I restore a previous version of my project?

Using a version control system like Git brings a fantastic benefit: you can return to any old version of your project at any time.
Returning to an Old Revision

The fastest way to restore an old version is to use the "reset" command:

$ git reset --hard 0ad5a7a6

This will rewind your HEAD branch to the specified version. All commits that came after this version are effectively undone; your project is exactly as it was at that point in time.

The reset command comes with a couple of options, one of the more interesting ones being the "--soft" flag. If you use it instead of --hard, Git will keep all the changes in those "undone" commits as local modifications:

$ git reset --soft 0ad5a7a6

You'll be left with a couple of changes in your working copy and can then decide what to do with them.
