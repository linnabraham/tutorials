When using bash variable assignment, you cannot have spaces around your '=' sign. 

Shell scripts will run each command sequentially, waiting for the first to finish before the next one starts.
There is no need for ; if the commands are on separate lines. You can also choose to run the second command only if the first exited successfully. 
To do so, join them with &&


Using sed to extract lines in a text file 
If you write bash scripts a lot, you are bound to run into a situation where you want to extract some lines from a file.
So, let's try extracting lines using sed: the stream editor.
Let's use the p sed command (for print) 

To extract a range of lines, say lines 2 to 4, you can execute either of the following:
sed -n 2,4p somefile.txt
sed '2,4!d' somefile.txt

You can tell sed to delete all but the first line.
sed '1!d' somefile.txt
